# springboot-security-properties #

The ```spring-boot-starter-security``` dependency enables the authentication and authorization in all end-points.

The following properties override the user creation default security configuration:

```
spring.security.user.name=donald
spring.security.user.password=duck
```

The default security configuration does not include any settings for authorization.
